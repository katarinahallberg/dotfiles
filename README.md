# dotfiles

Originally forked from https://github.com/frippz/dotfiles, so thanks to [Fredrik Frodlund](https://github.com/frippz) for a starting point and help.

## Usage

Make sure you're running `zsh` first, since many of the dotfiles assumes this.

```zsh
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Bootstrap!

```zsh
$ script/bootstrap
```

All done!
